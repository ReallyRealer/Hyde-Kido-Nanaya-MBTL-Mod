# Hyde Kido + Nanaya Shiki Expansion Pack
My mod that features a (UNi2) Hyde port & a custom Nanaya that has alternated versions of Tohno's moves to replicate MBAACC Nanaya


Atm this is only my FB project

**CREDITS:** MBTL GX made by U4ick (I reused & edited some of its assets for Nanaya's Arc Drive & Last Arc)

and [Fatih120 ](https://github.com/Fatih120) for making the Nanaya idle sprite edit

- 623B + B (cancels 623B into a upwards flip)
- 0202x is just his tp series
- J2B (kick dive)
- 214x is a new series (mainly just reused his boss rush 0202D adds but as separate moves)
- 2BC is a TP stance that can be canceled into A or B (holding backwards will make him go the opposite direction) you can also cancel into A twice or A into B
- 6BC is a special version of his regular 236x series where he'll uppercut upon hit and if you press B upon hitting you'll be able to cancel into his upwards TP
