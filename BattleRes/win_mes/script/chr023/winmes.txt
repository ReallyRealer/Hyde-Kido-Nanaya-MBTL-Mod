Looking back, I've sure wound up in a lot of trouble, 
thanks to Insulator... But fate is fate, so what 
can you do? Guess I don't have much choice but to 
stick around...

Finally figured out how flaky you've been, huh?
You've gotta give it all you got...
Or else you're not gonna be able to stop me tonight!
\e


WinMes02:

Kgh... Dammit, Insulator, calm down!
You're all pumped up for the final battle, huh? 
Fine, fine... Take us to the finish line with 
everything you got...

No wonder you can't win.
You don't learn, which means you don't grow.
And look, that's coming from ME. Just saying.
\e


WinMes04:

Your simplistic offense won't work on me.
It might've worked before, but not this time.
\e


WinMes05:
chara_type 100
Damn... That actually hurt!
Not like I can let a little scratch stop 
me now, though.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 100
Guh...
Just how many people do I have to beat 
for this to be over?
\e


WinMes07:

I know this sounds cheesy, but you can't understand 
strength until you've grown strong yourself. That's how 
I understand that I just faced one crazy-ass fighter.

Of course I fought back with everything I've got!
That's only respectful, right? So c'mon, no hard feelings...
